Project Proposal

Team mates: Carrie Cramer and Tarana Chowdhury

We plan to create a line-following robot. This robot will use optical sensors to detect the line and then follow it accordingly.
 This project involves analyzing sensor inputs and outputting the data to the motor to trigger physical movement of 
a robot. The main hardware components that we will need are a DC motor, photoresistors, wheels, and a battery.
